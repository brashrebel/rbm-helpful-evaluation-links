### Helpful Site Evaluation Links

This plugin just adds a meta box to the "evaluations" post type on realbigmarketing.com and
includes in that meta box a list of links which may be helpful to include in a report.

Pull requests are welcome for enhancing usability and adding links which may often be used
to educate and persuade prospective clients.
